//
// RT64
//
// Pokemon Snap port: an on-disk store for compiled shader bytecode.
//
// Turning the camera reveals materials the renderer has never drawn before, and
// each one is compiled from HLSL and linked against the shader libraries while
// the game runs. The renderer draws through the ubershader until the specialised
// one is ready, so nothing waits on it directly, but the compile is heavyweight
// work on several threads and the driver serialises parts of pipeline creation
// behind locks the drawing thread wants -- which is the micro-stutter a first
// playthrough shows whenever the view opens onto something new.
//
// The compiler's output is deterministic: the same shader source produces the
// same bytecode every time. So it only has to be produced once per machine
// rather than once per launch.
//
// This is purely a speed cache and cannot change what is drawn. The bytes it
// returns are the exact bytes the compiler handed the device when they were
// stored, and every way it can fail -- absent, wrong GPU, wrong driver, wrong
// build, truncated, corrupt, or not a shader container at all -- lands on the
// same code that runs today.
