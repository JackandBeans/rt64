/**
 * @file rt64_snap_diag.h
 * @brief Shared pieces of the Pokemon Snap port's diagnostics.
 *
 * Two things live here, both born from the code review of the transition-cut
 * work.
 *
 * The gate: the port accumulated a family of [SNAP-*] printf probes across
 * the renderer while the corner flash was being hunted. Left always-on they
 * cost formatting and flushes in hot paths and they are release-cleanup debt
 * scattered across a vendored fork. Every probe family now asks diagEnabled()
 * first, so shipping quiet builds is one environment variable, and stripping
 * the probes later is a search for one symbol.
 *
 * The dump helpers: both capture rigs (the game-side RDRAM dumper in
 * src/frame_dump.cpp and the present-queue capture) previously hand-rolled
 * their own BMP writer, directory creation, and file numbering. The writers
 * had diverging row-padding rules and both counted failed writes as
 * successes. One implementation now serves both, reports failure honestly,
 * and stamps every filename with a per-run token so a later run can never
 * silently overwrite an earlier run's evidence.

// still stepping at the game's rate. That statistic can confirm the mechanism
// works and can never reveal how much of the screen it reaches. This one can.
// Which code drew the rectangles nothing has named. Coverage says how much of
// the screen is reached; these say what is standing in the way of reaching the
// rest, which decides whether a native hook is enough or the function has to be
// replaced on the game side.
// Of the rectangles nothing has named, how many sat in exactly the same place
// as a rectangle on the previous drawn frame.
//
// A rectangle that does not move does not need interpolating: naming it would
// pair it with itself and blend two identical positions. So raw coverage
// overstates the problem, and the number that actually matters is how much of
// the unnamed content MOVES. Matching on exact coordinates cannot tell one
// still rectangle from another, but it does not have to -- if a rectangle with
// these exact corners was on screen last frame too, then whatever drew it did
// not move it.
// Rectangles the renderer actually moved, counted where it moves them. Pairing
// a rectangle and drawing it somewhere between two positions are different
// steps, and only the second one is what anybody sees.
// Which half of the condition to move a rectangle failed. Pairing marks the
// rectangle; the weight says where between the two frames this image sits. If
// rectangles arrive at the renderer still marked but always at weight one, the
// pairing is fine and the image being drawn is simply never between anything.
// Paired rectangles whose SIZE changed between the two drawn frames, and the
// largest such change.
//
// Position and size are lerped together, but they do not mean the same thing. A
// sprite that moves is a sprite moving. A sprite whose rectangle changes size
// has usually changed to a different picture -- animation is a texture swap in
// this game, and consecutive frames of an animation need not be the same
// dimensions. Blending between two sizes then stretches the NEW image smoothly
// across the interval, because the texture coordinates were computed for the
// authored rectangle and the quad is scaled by the viewport. That reads as a
// sprite breathing or popping rather than as a sprite moving.
// Raised by the player, at the moment they see the thing they are reporting.
//
// Every statistic here is averaged over six hundred presents, which is about
// two seconds -- long enough that a fault lasting a few frames is diluted into
// nothing by the frames either side of it. A run that has to be described
// afterwards from memory is exactly the position this project keeps getting
// stuck in. Pressing a key ends the interval on the spot, so the numbers that
// print next describe the moment and not the two seconds around it.
// Set by the mark key alongside the interval cut: the next matcher run prints
// every pair it makes, so the moment the player is looking at arrives as the
// actual pairs -- which id joined which rectangle to which -- rather than as
// aggregates. Aggregates have been misread here more than once; a pair listing

//
//   unchanged  -> the content is not a rectangle. It is geometry or a billboard
//                 going through the matrix path, and everything done to the
//                 rectangle path was aimed at the wrong half of the renderer.

// which is current behaviour.

// tags were written.
//
// This settles whether the register the tag reads is one particle or something
// shared between them. If every tag names a different address the register is

// tags then the name is a group, the number folded in beside it is nothing but
// draw order, and pairing on it matches whichever particle happened to be drawn
// in that position -- which is order-based pairing, the failure that tore the
// laboratory background into bands, reintroduced inside the effect system.
//
